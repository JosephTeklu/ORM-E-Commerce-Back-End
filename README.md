## Description 
  This program provides the fundmentals of the back end of an ecommerce website. Using Sequelize and Express as dependicies on Node.js product/category/tag models and routes were created to give the functionality of GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE through api calls. This solves the probelm of having a diffucult db and allows the user to have a clean db and easy ways of munuplating the data in it. By making this project I was able to hone in my Sequelize skills and make do of using SQL in easier formats by crating models and routs and minuplation thorugh apis.
